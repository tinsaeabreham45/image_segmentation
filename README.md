# Semantic Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)


A Jupyter Notebook implementation of semantic segmentation using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) trained on a custom dataset. This project focuses on pixel-wise classification for urban scene understanding.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project performs semantic segmentation using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to classify each pixel in images into categories like `sky`, `building`, `road`, `vegetation`, and others. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle and contains annotated urban scene images.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing pipeline for images and masks
- Custom dataset loader for training/validation splits
- Visualization utilities for segmentation masks
- FCN model implementation (to be expanded in the notebook)
- GPU acceleration support via TensorFlow

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/6869972/fcnn-dataset)) contains:
